# Correlation-analysis
Mathematical modeling to investigate the correlations between components in regulatory networks. 

modelXY1.m : Two toy models were developed to represent two typical types of biological regulatory networks respectively: Model1 described a multi-step signaling cascade and Model2 characterized a multi-regulator-controlled gene expression system. 

modelXY1_noise.m : Random errors and background noise were added to the datasets, and then the corresponding correlation coefficients at the single-cell or the population level were calculated.

modelXY3.m : Model3 is a previously published model of mammalian cell cycle regulatory network, the parameters of which were experimentally derived (Yao G. et.al. Nat Cell Biol 2008).
